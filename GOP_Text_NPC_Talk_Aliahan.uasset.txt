Text=*: It pains me to say that we have had no word from Ortega since he left for the volcano...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_Event_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_Event_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=...Well, no time like the present.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_Event_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=I know.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_Event_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=I'll go and wake them now.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Cooee! Wakey-wakey, rise and shiiine!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Morning, my darling! It's time to get up! Today's a very important day!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=After all, it's not every morning you ask the king himself to give your big journey his personal blessing!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=This is what I've been raising you for all these years!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Well then, shall we get going? Come on! Follow me!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Come on, dear! You know where the castle is<--->straight on now!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Off you go, and remember to mind your manners! I won't have the king thinking you've been dragged up!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=What in heaven's name are you doing, child? Off with you now and see the king!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=And where exactly do you think you're going, hm? Have you changed your mind about going to meet the king?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Well you could have fooled me! Now stop being so silly, and run along to the castle. And BE POLITE!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Oh you have, have you? Well, if you don't go and see him today, he might never grant you an audience again.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Is that what you want? Well? Is it?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Well, if you're going to be like that, I shan't bother saying any more.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=I'm off home, dear, but I'll ask you one last time before I go: are you sure you don't want to meet the king?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Alright then. You're old enough to make your own decisions. Far be it from me to stop you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=You do whatever you want, {HERO}. Just don't go getting into trouble, you hear?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Good. I should think so too. Now, off with you, and don't forget to be polite.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=............
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_010
Text=Alright then, I'll be off home.<cf>Look after yourself, won't you? (sniff)
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Well met, child of Ortega!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=*: We could not locate any of Ortega's belongings.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=I see... To think something out there is capable of besting a man of his calibre...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=My husband thought long and hard before setting off. I'm sure he was at peace when he passed.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Doubtless, your mother has recounted the tale of your father's final moments many times.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=When he fell into the maw of that accursed volcano, the world lost a great man.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=However, we wholeheartedly approve of your wish to follow in his footsteps and set forth on the path of adventure.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=For it is what he would have wanted. And only the child of such a hero as he could hope to save our world.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=The foe we face is dire indeed<--->the Archfiend Baramos!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Many of the peoples of this world do not yet even know his name.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=And yet, his grip on our realm grows ever tighter.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=He must be stopped<--->no matter the cost!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=You must free us from the Archfiend's ever-encroaching tyranny!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=But alone, you will only meet the same fate as your father.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Go and consult with Mistress Patty in town. And use this to outfit the companions she has selected for you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text={HERO} receives 50 gold coins and some basic equipment, and puts them in the bag!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Allow me to proffer some guidance: you would be wise to seek out the thief's key, an implement that can open a myriad of the world's doors; obtain it and your travels will be that bit easier.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=But first, I suggest you heed His Majesty's advice and seek like-minded individuals at Patty's Party Planning Place.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Once you have done so, try making your way to Reeve, a quaint village to the north-west of our fair kingdom.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=You will now find Reeve marked on your map. Locating the rest of the realm's noteworthy areas, however, is a task I believe best left in your capable hands.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=You simply need note down anywhere you happen to visit. Be sure to see these places with your own eyes first, though, otherwise you'll likely forget to mark them on your map.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=And remember: your curiosity is an asset most valuable. Lend it an ear at all times and you will surely benefit. However, remain wary, lest it lead you into trouble on occasion...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=We expect great things of you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Ahh, so you have deigned to grace us with your presence at last. We had begun to think that you were not coming.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=So, you are the child from all those years ago... You have grown.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=You will not remember, but we have met once before.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=It was on the day when we received word of your father's passing...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Ortega was a true hero of our realm. One of the greatest.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=His loss came as a blow to us all...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=Well, well... If it is not the child of the mighty Ortega!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=...Who set off for adventure without the permission of their king, and with no companions!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=So you have finally deigned to grace us with your presence...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=No matter. It is not yet too late to begin your journey.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0110_010
Text=But the time to treat your quest with the gravity it deserves has arrived...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_020
Text=*: Look, {HERO}'s back!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_020
Text=*: Our hero has returned! All hail the hero, fresh from defeating the dastardly Baramos!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_020
Text=*: Hooray! Hooraaay!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_020
Text=*: So peace really has returned at last?<cf>Well, I'll be...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_020
Text=*: Thank you, {HERO}. Thank you so much. From all of us.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Ohh, welcome home, my little champion! I'm so proud and happy, I could burst!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Ahh, if only your father could see you...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Just look at you. You've grown into a great adventurer. The spitting image of your father.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=And I know, somewhere out there, he's just as chuffed as I am.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Well met indeed, vanquisher of the Archfiend Baramos!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Truly, you are your father's child! The kingdom<--->nay, the whole world<--->salutes you!

Text=Well met indeed, vanquisher of the Archfiend Baramos!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=That one such as you should topple such a fearsome tyrant as the Archfiend is miraculous indeed!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Truly, you are your father's child, and every bit his equal in prowess!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Such excellence demands recognition. Here! A gift, from your humbled king to you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text={HERO} is presented with a shiny new bastard sword!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Well met indeed, vanquisher of the Archfiend Baramos!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Truly, you are your father's child! And your companions, too, are touched with greatness! The kingdom<--->nay, the whole world<--->salutes you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Servants! A feast must be prepared, the like of which our land has never seen!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Hm hm hm hm hm!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030_18_02
Text=I must apologise for intruding on such a heartwarming scene!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=I am Zoma. Master of darkness. Lord of the Underworld.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=And so long as I will it, your realm shall never be free of the pall of night.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Now...suffer!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Your pain shall be my pleasure!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=All shall know despair! All shall kneel!<cf>All shall give their lives in sacrifice to my glory!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=For I am Zoma, bringer of oblivion!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Obey, and your suffering shall be short! Resist, and you shall know true torment!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Hm hm hm hm hm!<cf>HA HA HA HA HAAA!!!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=*: Is everyone unharmed!?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=*: What was that!?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=No... It cannot be. Not now. Not when peace had finally returned to the land...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Will it forever remain beyond our reach...?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Everyone present, listen, and listen well:
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=My subjects must never learn of Zoma's existence.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Their lives have been ruled by unease for long enough...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Oh, Goddess... Which is the path I must take...? Ah, forgive me a moment of weakness. Now, please, leave me...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=The appearance of Zoma, Lord of the Underworld, proved a rude awakening for {HERO} upon <IfGender_HERO(his,her,)> return to Aliahan.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=However, as per the king's decree, the truth of the day's events was confined to those within the throne room.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_MAIN_0_VOLUME_0010_030
Text=Then, later that night, as the townspeople slept...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=What's the matter? Can't you sleep?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Suppose it's no surprise really; you've been through your fair share.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Ooh, just thinking of that horrible voice we heard in the castle sends shivers down my spine.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=But enough of that. Tell me: do you know what you're going to do next?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Gosh, just listen to you. Your old mum couldn't be prouder...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=It's alright. I'm still in shock too...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=I had hoped this would be the end of it, but I know you can't just stay here. You're just like your father in that sense.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Oh, this all brings back memories of when he left Aliahan to go on his journey.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=His friends presented him with the finest helmet you've ever seen...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Everyone came out to wish him well. They were all so joyous, but there was nothing but fear in my heart...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Oh, this is quite the helm indeed...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=Can't it wait until <IfGender_HERO(he's,she's,)> a little bit older?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=I just don't want to lose you too...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=...Oh, I'm sorry. Don't worry, everything will be alright.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_030
Text=At any rate, I'd say it's well past your bedtime. Go on, you must be shattered. We can talk in the morning.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_040
Text=Then, morning comes...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_040
Text=Morning, my darling!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_040
Text=I suppose it's that time again, eh?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_040
Text=I know there's no stopping you; just promise me you'll take care, alright?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_040
Text=And know I'll be here for you with open arms whenever you come home.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_MAIN_0_SCENE_0010_040
Text=So, bye for now. Do pop by again if you ever find yourself missing my cooking!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=Welcome home, dear! Why, you certainly look the part today. Go on, let your mother have a<--->
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=Oh my...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=I could never forget that helmet even if I tried.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=It's still crystal clear in my memory, you know. The day your father's friends gave it to him for his journey.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=*: Morning! Gosh, you must be bubbling with emotions now Ortega's departure is so close.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=*: We know it's not much, but we got 'im a little somefink...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=Oh, this is quite the helm indeed...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=I can still see it. The fire in his eyes when he first donned that helmet.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=But just look at it now...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=Covered in scratches. Poor Ortega must've gone through so much...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=Still, thank you for showing it to me. You should keep ahold of it; it's what your father would've wanted.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=I mean it. I don't need his helm when I've already got so many wonderful memories.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=And I imagine you'll need something to keep your head out of harm's way on your travels.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_SCENE_0010_050
Text=Now, how about we lighten the mood with some food? I'll make us something extra special.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Oh, welcome home, muffin!<cf>My dear, sweet {HERO}!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=You must be worn out from all that running around! Come on now, off to bed with you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=What's that? Of course your little friends can stay too! The more the merrier! Goodnight, children!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Morning, darling! Go on now, off you go and do some adventuring!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Whatever's the matter, dear? Are you tired of adventuring?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Well, I'm sure you are. And Mummy would love to be with her darling {HERO} forever and ever.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=But there comes a time when every child must fly the nest.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Now off you go! Get out there and make your father proud!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=I should think not! Whatever would your father say?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Wh-What!? What's happened to {HERO}!?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Oh no... Don't say it... Don't say I've lost <IfGender_HERO(him,her,)> too! Living without Ortega was hard enough...but this?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Please, you have to help <IfGender_HERO(him,her,)>... Help my {HERO}... My only child...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Welcome back, my darling! So? Did you see the king? And were you nice and polite like you promised?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Thank goodness for that.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=I was petrified you'd trip over or say the wrong thing, or...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Well, it doesn't matter now. You have the king's permission to go off adventuring! You're officially a grown-up!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=You weren't? Oh dear... But then, it was your first time at court, wasn't it?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=I mean, you can't be expected to make it through without a slip-up or two, can you, now?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Anyway, you must be ever so tired after all that excitement. Off to bed with you, sweetums!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Morning, darling! Go on now, off you go and do some adventuring!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Welcome back, dear. Are you still stubbornly avoiding the king and your duties?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=You went? Even after everything you said?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Ohh, you have no idea how proud you've made your mother!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Anyway, you must be ever so tired after all that excitement. Off to bed with you, sweetums!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Now hold on just a moment, young <IfGender_HERO(man,lady,)>. Don't think you can fool me.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=I know very well that you didn't go.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=But I'm sure you have your reasons, so I shan't interfere.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Just don't go getting yourself into trouble, alright? Now be off with you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Really? Are you really that determined not to meet him? Ohh, whatever are we going to do with you?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=But I'm sure you have your reasons, so I shan't interfere.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Anyway, you must be ever so tired after all that excitement. Off to bed with you, sweetums!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Ohh, welcome home, my little champion! I'm so proud and happy, I could burst!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Ahh, if only your father could see you...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Eh? Where's my little champion, hm? What have you done with my {HERO}?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=You tell that little rascal to get home, or there'll be trouble!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Anyway, just promise you'll look after yourself, alright? I'll be here for you if you ever need me.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=Welcome home, dear! I was starting to wonder where you'd got to!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=Haven't you finished with all that adventuring nonsense yet?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=So it's still not over? Well then, I suppose your poor old mother will just have to wait patiently until you can finally come home.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=I do hope my little champion is getting enough rest. You'll look after <IfGender_HERO(him,her,)>, won't you?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=You tell that little rascal to come home from time to time, or there'll be trouble!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Welcome back, darling! Guess what? Your father's returned! Your father! He's alive!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Ohhh, I'm so happy, I could...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Look, darling! Look! It's your father! In the flesh!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=He's alive! After all this time! Oh, I'm so, so, so happy, I could... Oh, look at me!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Unbelievable... <IfGender_HERO(His,Her,)> father returns from the dead, and <IfGender_HERO(he,she,)>'s not here to see it. Goddess willing <IfGender_HERO(he,she,)> comes home soon and we can be one happy family again.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Welcome home, my darling! I've been busy telling your father about everything that happened while he was away.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=After all, there's a lot to tell!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=So much so that I just can't stop talking! Ohh, me and my big mouth! Hee hee!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=I just can't stop talking! We've got so much catching up to do! Hee hee!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=You're the most heroic hero in the whole wide world! My own flesh and blood! Who'd have thought it? Well, me, obviously...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=Like father, like <IfGender_HERO(son,daughter,)>, eh? Or, more importantly, like grandfather, like grand<IfGender_HERO(son,daughter,)>! Heh heh!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=So, you're my little one, eh? It's the strangest thing: I know this is the first time I've laid eyes on you all grown up...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=...yet I feel like we just met a short while ago.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=You know what? Don't mind me. I think I'm just a bit tired.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=So, you're my little one, eh? Well, not so little any more...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=When I left, you were barely the size of my thumb, and now look at you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=And I'm sorry. I've put you through a lot...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=So, what do you get up to with your time? ...What? You set out to follow in my footsteps and destroy the Archfiend?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Well, now. There's not much I can say to that, is there?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Just don't go making your mother worry too much, will you? She's been through enough already.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=You've grown into a fine young adventurer, {HERO}.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=I almost wish I could set out with you, but I couldn't do that to your poor mother.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Especially not after all that I've put her through already...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Well, I've done all I can. It's time to pick up where your old man left off, {HERO}.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=And I'm sure you'll do me proud<--->you look like you could snap the Lord of the Underworld in two with one hand!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=............
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=He seems to be lost in thought.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Ah, it's you, {HERO}. Good. There's something I've been meaning to ask you<--->it's about your mother...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Um, it's lovely of her to want to tell me everything that's been going on, but...is there a way of getting her to stop?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=No? Well, I suppose I'll just have to grin and bear it, then. It is nice that she's so excited to see me, after all...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=I'm not sure why, but it just occurred to me that I left something in a village by the name of Mur on my travels.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=It's probably long gone at this point, but at the very least I'd like to go and thank them for looking after it.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Wait, that's it: my helmet! What are you doing with it?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Oh, don't worry about returning it. You'll get far more use out of it than I will.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=That said, I don't remember it having quite so many scratches. There's an old friend of mine who could...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Ah, but there's hardly enough time for that, and it's still just about fit for purpose.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Honestly, just look at you, {HERO}...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=In slaying Baramos you've already bested anything I ever accomplished.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=Just know that I'm the proudest father there is, and nothing will ever change that.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=What's more, you've still got your whole life ahead of you; who knows how you'll surprise us in the future.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Ortega was real hero material, you know. Your father was something special. And his father before him! Heh!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=You've a lot to live up to, {HERO}<--->don't let your grandfather down!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Where's that young scallywag {HERO}, hm?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Left <IfGender_HERO(his,her,)> friends to do the hard work while <IfGender_HERO(he,she,)> goes off gallivanting, no doubt...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0120_010
Text=Zzz... Ortega! Son... Why did you have to go and...? (sob) Zzz... Zzz...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Nothing quite like waking up to beautiful blue skies, is there, my <IfGender_HERO(boy,girl,)>?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Listen, you've more than earned the right to make your own decisions. I'll be behind you whatever choice you make.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Now go and show that brute what's what! Don't worry, I'll still be here when you get back.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0120_020
Text=Honestly, I think you've earned yourself the right to some rest, don't you? Get back to bed now.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=That's my boy! Alive in spite of all the odds! That's powerful blood running through those veins<--->my blood! Heh!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=I never dared even dream of this day! To see my <IfGender_HERO(grandson,granddaughter,)> and son reunited... How joyous!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Praise be to the Goddess for keeping him safe all this time.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_House1_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0120_040
Text=Zzz... My own flesh and blood... Immortal... And all thanks to me... Zzz... Zzz...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_VOLUME_0010_010
Text=*: And exactly where do you think you're going? His Majesty awaits you in the throne room!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: This is the castle town of Aliahan, as you know.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: If you're planning on heading out for a hike, you could do worse than visit the picturesque village of Reeve to the north-west.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=*: Welcome home to Aliahan!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=*: We've heard the news already<--->you beat Baramos! Hooray!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=*: Welcome home to Aliahan!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=*: Hey, you'll never guess what! Red-hot gossip<--->Ortega, hero of Aliahan is back from the dead! I knooow!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: Time was, Aliahan ruled over all the world.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: But then came the wars, and we lost so many of our young men...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: They say it was the fighting which led them to close the teleportal to the mainland...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=*: So you beat that blighter Baramos, did you? You really are a hero!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_030
Text=*: Did you feel the ground shake earlier on? I could have sworn I felt something...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_030
Text=*: Hm. Well, it was only a little tremor. Probably nothing...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_030
Text=*: No? Must be my old bones shaking...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_040
Text=*: It's the funniest thing... Baramos is gone, but...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_040
Text=*: I just don't feel like the world is at peace yet...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_050
Text=*: So Ortega was alive the whole time, the rascal? Well, well! There's a turn-up for the books!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: The castle is closed at night-time. If you want to meet the king, you'll have to go there during the day.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_020
Text=*: I heard of a so-called <6>golden country<9> far away to the north of here, across the sea. Jipang, they call it. What I wouldn't give to see the place...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_030
Text=*: Go on, get over to the castle! The king probably can't wait to congratulate you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_040
Text=*: I bet the king was over the moon, wasn't he?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_040
Text=*: Ha! Why am I even asking? Of course he was!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_050
Text=*: Baramos has definitely been defeated, hasn't he?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_050
Text=*: Yes, of course he has. So this feeling I have<--->like we're still in danger<--->I'm just being silly, aren't I?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_050
Text=*: Huh? But how can that be? The castle guards said they went to check, and it was definitely true...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: On a nice, sunny day like this, the whole idea of the Archfiend destroying the world just seems impossible, doesn't it?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_020
Text=*: So big, bad Baramos is gone, is he?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_020
Text=*: Do you think that means all the horrible monsters will go away too? I hope so. Then we could go outside and play.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_030
Text=*: I tried to go outside the city to play the other day.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_030
Text=*: But as soon as I got out there, I saw a huge, great, big stark raven, and I got scared and came back home.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_040
Text=*: Hey, Mr Ortega's back, isn't he? Everyone's talking about it!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: If you leave town and wait a while, eventually it will get dark.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: And when that happens, you want to be careful<--->the meaner monsters just love the night-time! If you get scared, find an inn and wait it out till morning.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_020
Text=*: If you leave town and wait a while, eventually it will get dark.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_020
Text=*: The meaner monsters just love the night-time! If you get scared, find an inn and wait it out till morning.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_030
Text=*: Now we can all live happily and peacefully ever after!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_040
Text=*: It's weird, isn't it? The Archfiend has gone, but there are still monsters all over the place.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: Have you seen that funny little island off to the west of town?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: Well, the building standing on it is known as the Dreamer's Tower. And a strange old place it is too...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: Walk a little way west of town, and you'll spot it soon enough.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_020
Text=*: I could swear I've been hearing voices drifting up out of the well for a while now.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_020
Text=*: You don't think there's somebody trapped down there, do you?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_030
Text=*: What's that? You beat Baramos? The Archfiend? Well now, that really is something!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: 'Ello, 'ello, 'ello! I'm your local guardsman on the beat, 'ere to keep the streets free of trouble!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: You may set off on your quest, safe in the knowledge that your 'ometown is in good 'ands!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_020
Text=*: But without Baramos to worry about, what will we guardsmen do with ourselves?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_030
Text=*: Now that Ortega's back, we've got nothing to fear in the whole wide world!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_030
Text=*: Even if a horde of monsters attacks the town, he'll send them packing, and be done in time for breakfast!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_010
Text=*: Ah! You're the young fellow I met over at Patty's place, aren't you?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_010
Text=*: Ah! You're the young lady I met over at Patty's place, aren't you?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_010
Text=*: Well, whoever you are, just look at that moon! Here's to it! Cheers! (glug glug) Hic!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_020
Text=*: Wassat? You beat big, bad Baramos?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_020
Text=*: Bully for you! You must be<--->Hic!<--->breathtakingly, um...blissful. BURP! Heh heh... Hic!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_030
Text=*: Cor, lookathat! Look! You! Oi<--->Hic<--->lookadit! The moon! It's flipping<--->Burp!<--->beautiful! Hahahahaha!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0820_040
Text=*: Wassat? Yeah, turns out Ortega wasn't dead after all. Who'd have<--->Hic!<--->thunk it?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_0920_010
Text=*: I'm afraid I've shut up shop for the day. Why don't you get some sleep, then come back and see me tomorrow?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1020_010
Text=Well now, we are up late, aren't we? But you're still in one piece, that's the main thing.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1020_010
Text=Go on, inside with you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1210_010
Text=*: Let us pray for peace. Even if it brings us only one day closer to salvation, it will be worthwhile.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1210_020
Text=*: The peoples of the world are safe, and no words can express our gratitude. Goddess bless you, my child.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1210_030
Text=*: Though the Archfiend is defeated, I cannot help but feel a certain trepidation still. I pray that my instincts are wrong...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1310_010
Text=*: Sounds like they're holding a feast in the castle to celebrate the fall of the Archfiend.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1310_010
Text=*: Have to say, I'm more than a bit jealous of your mum and grandfather getting invited; they must be beyond proud of you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1410_010
Text=*: Have you ever looked in a pot or a barrel? You can find all sorts of stuff if you're lucky. Things people have thrown away, things they've put in there and forgotten about...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1410_010
Text=*: Honestly, my mum's always telling me to tidy up and meanwhile grown-ups are just chucking their things in pots and barrels. Lucky them<--->they've got me to clean up their mess, at least!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1510_010
Text=*: You ever heard of Kirk Buzzer? People call him a master thief, but he's nothing more than a burglar who steals from people's wardrobes and drawers.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1510_010
Text=*: A nuisance is what he is, and his behaviour sets a terrible example for the children. Not like you, though<--->our paragon of truth and justice!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1610_010
Text=*: That reminds me, I should check in on that odd bloke I found in that well once...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Out_SUB_0_ACTOR_1610_010
Text=*: Some of my fellow guards mentioned they had been paying him visits from time to time, but I'd love to know what he's actually up to down there.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Welcome to Patty's Party Planning Place, where the adventurers of the world come together!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Wait just a second. It's little old {HERO}! Aw, look at you all dressed up in your adventuring gear.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Hang on... You're not playing around, are you? You're actually going out there...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Might be a good idea to go see the king first. I heard he wants to give your journey his royal blessing.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=Naturally, I'll be more than happy to help once you've seen His Majesty, so do come back later, alright?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Hey, you. Still can't believe this day's finally here...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=I remember when you popped out of your mother like it was yesterday, you know.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=Oh, and don't be thinking I'm ridiculously old or anything; I was just a kid back then, but it felt like I suddenly had a new sibling to look after.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=To think that was sixteen whole years ago...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=At any rate, I'm sure you know by now, but Patty's Party Planning Place is your one-stop shop for all things adventuring.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=If you find yourself feeling lonely on the road, or simply want some muscle you can count on in a pinch, let me know! I'll find the perfect companions to suit your needs.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=But, gosh, you really are all grown up now, aren't you? May take me a while to get used to... At any rate...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text={HERO}! I knew you'd do it, but I still can't quite believe you actually took down Baramos.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=You know, something tells me business is about to start booming and it's all thanks to you!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030
Text=But forget that; have you been to see the king yet? He's going to want to throw a banquet in your honour, I know it!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Hey there.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=I heard all about what went on in the castle. You must be all shook up right now... Still crazy to think Baramos was just someone's lackey...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Oh, no need to look so surprised: I know about Zoma too. My sources never let me down.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=In fact, I reckon it's high time I told you exactly how my Party Planning Place came to be.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=You see, when the king heard of your father's passing, he couldn't let go of the fact that it was him who sent Ortega off with no help.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=That drove His Majesty to create a spot where adventurers could meet, exchange ideas and form parties.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Anyway, this is what got built.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=I did my part too: called in some favours and got the first few adventurers through the door. Then the king used his coffers to summon some more.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=As time passed, this place grew into the bustling hub you know today. Gotta say, when you came in here on your birthday, I got a bit emotional.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Honestly, if the Party Planning Place has helped you out even a little bit, then I'd be happier than a slime on Sunday.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Oh, and don't worry: no one here's timid enough to get scared off by someone who calls himself <6>lord<9> of anything. I can promise you that.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040
Text=Patty's Party Planning Place is still here for you just like it's always been. And that's never going to change.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=I just heard the news about Ortega. You must be over the moon! Oh, I'm so happy for you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Boy, you should've seen the king's face when he heard. Now that was a sight! He was smiling from ear to ear!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Brought a smile to my face too seeing him so happy again.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=<1>Course, I'm delighted to have Ortega back too. He was always such a gentleman to me when I was a little girl.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Just thinking about it really takes me back... I used to adore listening to tales of all the adventures he went on.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Every time I heard he'd come back to town I'd go pester him to tell me all about his latest trip.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Then, one day, I asked if he could teach me how to wield a blade.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=I wasn't quite strong enough for a broadsword or anything like that, so I had him show me how to use a dagger.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=I know I wouldn't be nearly so fleet of foot if it hadn't been for his help. He taught me so much...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=And I still make use of everything I learned to this day!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=How exactly? Well, you know, my dagger skills come in handy in the kitchen and I serve tables quicker than anyone!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=Oh, did you think I was going out there in my spare time slaying monsters? Ha, sorry to burst your bubble.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=No, I've got my hands full just looking after this place and all the adventurers who walk through its doors.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: Wossat? Need a key, do ya? Come to fink o' it, I once knew a bloke who 'ad a knack for openin' doors. Went by the name <6>Kirk Buzzer<9>.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: 'Aven't seen 'im in a good while, mind you. Not since 'e 'eaded off for that tower on the island west o' 'ere.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: If you're looking to put together a good solid party, you'll want a warrior, a priest and a mage.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: If Patty over there doesn't have what you're looking for, head upstairs and get the recruitment people to find it for you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_020
Text=*: Hello there! Come and have a drink with me! I know how tasty a nice glass after a hard day's adventuring can be!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_020
Text=*: When I was your age, I used to go round with a martial artist, a thief and a priest, you know. Lovely bunch...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_020
Text=*: Well, apart from the priest, that is. Terrible, selfish fellow, he was... Never healed anybody...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_020
Text=*: Come to mention it, you look like a pretty selfish sort yourself, {WORD}. I can see it in your face. Oop! Forget I spoke!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_030
Text=*: Hey, have you heard? Ortega's alive, and he's back in town!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_030
Text=*: If he's planning on heading out on another adventure, I'll be first in line to sign up!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: Oh bother! I left my bag hanging on the wall of my room at the inn!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: And it had all my gold coins and herbs in it. Gah, it's probably long gone...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: Well, nothing I can do about it now. If someone has swiped it, I hope they put my things to good use at least.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: You can never have too many <Plr_I_NAME> if you ask me. Being able to fly to places you've been before in the blink of an eye is so magical. In fact...it probably is magic...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: Back in the dark old days you used to bump your head on the ceiling if you tried to use one indoors, but now you don't have to worry about any of that! Modern comforts, eh?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: You know, I found fifty gold coins on a bench the other day. Felt like the Goddess Herself had smiled on me!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: Ever since then I make a point of checking my surroundings wherever I go<--->never know when I'll strike it rich again, after all!

Text=*: Welcome to Premiere Adventurer Listing Services! With PALS, you're sure to build a winning team!<cf>We provide recruitment solutions to party leaders with royal approval.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: Now, let me see... {HERO}, was it? One moment...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: Ahh, I'm sorry. I can see here that you haven't been cleared to begin adventuring yet.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: I'll need you to pop along and see the king, and then come back once all the paperwork's been put through...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: Well, you've got your martial artists<--->they're quick as you like...<cf>Then there's your thieves<--->good for treasure hunting, obviously...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: Then, of course, there's merchants. They can appraise your items for you, which is pretty useful...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: Don't go anywhere near the gadabouts, though. Useless lot, they are, always mucking about in battles. Bunch of clowns, if you ask me...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_010
Text=*: If you insist on having one along, leave it until you're strong enough to carry some serious dead weight.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0220_010
Text=*: Ah-phew...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=*: We expected no less of you, son of Ortega! We have witnessed the birth of a true hero!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_020
Text=*: We expected no less of you, daughter of Ortega! We have witnessed the birth of a true hero!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_030
Text=*: Looks like you're more than tough enough to carry a gadabout these days. Why don't you give one a chance? Could be fun...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_040

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: If you ask me, there's two kinds of adventurer in this world: those that include conjurers like mages and priests in their parties, and those that don't.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: The ones that don't tend to go all out and fill their parties with warriors, martial artists and even merchants<--->vocations that focus on strength and stamina. Personally, I'd go for a more balanced line-up if I were you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: And if you really don't want to include any magic users, then why not take a monster wrangler or thief along for the ride?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: When I was a young whippersnapper, I made a point of stopping by the shops whenever I visited a new town. I used to love perusing the merchants' wares...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0610_010
Text=*: Now, an adventurer such as yourself will want to focus on the weapons and armour<--->if you're blessed in the strength department, get yourself a trusty weapon. Otherwise, concentrate on defensive gear.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: Monster wranglers are a special bunch, that's for sure...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: They ain't especially strong, and they definitely ain't much in the magic department neither, but they don't play by the rules<--->and that's what makes 'em so useful.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0710_010
Text=*: I 'appen to know a fair few adventurers out there that've benefited more than once from their 'ealin' abilities.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0810_010
Text=*: I've no idea who invented bags, but whoever did was a genius. Truly, how did we ever carry our possessions around without them?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0810_010
Text=*: That said, they're not much use during battles. You won't have time to reach into yours for items if you're preoccupied showing a slime what's what.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Luida_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0810_010
Text=*: No, if there's something you think you'll need in a fight, best to keep it on your<--->or a companion's<--->person!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Church_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: Aliahan sits upon a body of land surrounded entirely by the sea.

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Church_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: Ahh, if I could only catch a glimpse of those distant shores just once before I die...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Church_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=*: What's that? You beat Baramos? The Archfiend? Well now, that really is something!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Church_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Church_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_040

Text=*: Your father was a great man.<cf>A truly great man.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_WeaponShop_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: I heard that the child of Ortega has set off on some kind of quest.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_WeaponShop_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: I hope they'll become as brave and gallant a hero as their father.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_WeaponShop_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_WeaponShop_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020_1_02

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_WeaponShop_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_050
Text=*: Look at you! What a shining, strutting paragon of heroism!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0220_010
Text=*: Have you ever looked in a pot or a barrel? You can find all sorts of stuff if you're lucky. Things people have thrown away, things they've put in there and forgotten about...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_1F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0220_010
Text=*: Honestly, my mum's always telling me to tidy up and meanwhile grown-ups are just chucking their things in pots and barrels. Lucky them<--->they've got me to clean up their mess, at least!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: I was just enjoying some peace and quiet when suddenly an almighty bang came from his room!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_010
Text=*: Judging by how badly he's hurt, those things must be pretty dangerous...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=*: I bet there are other people out there besides the man in the room opposite who have tried to make wrecking balls.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_020
Text=*: The only way to find out is to get out and look for them. It's a big, wide world out there!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Inn_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_030

SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_100
Text=Furthermore, should you come into possession of rare curios with no obvious use, do not cast them aside. Their purpose may only become apparent in the most unexpected of places.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_110
Text={LEADER}, I have information of great value. I must apologise for not telling you at an earlier juncture, but know that it is because I had your own safety at the forefront of my mind.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_110
Text=It concerns Ortega... His pursuit of Baramos all those years ago took him to a distant continent many leagues to the west, where he attempted to scale a volcano.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_110
Text=If any clue as to Baramos's whereabouts is to be found, it will be in the vicinity of that fiery peak.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0110_110
Text=However, as we know only too well, Ortega never did return... This can mean but one thing: the area is far from hospitable. Promise your king that you will take care.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_030
Text=At last, the name of Aliahan resounds across the world once more! This is truly an auspicious day!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_040
Text=My apologies, but even the king's considerable energy must be replenished from time to time.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_040
Text=I hope that I may be of service to you in his stead.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_040
Text=After all, the royal court must carry on, business as usual. We cannot risk sowing unease amongst the populace.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_050
Text=So Ortega, who we had thought lost, is returned to us! This is truly an auspicious day!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_050
Text=Perhaps I might consult with him about the issue of Zoma, Lord of the Underworld...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_050
Text=His Majesty has still not reached a decision. I fear it weighs upon his mind most heavily...
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_050
Text=If only to ease his burden, I will take his place for a short while.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_060
Text=It is far too dangerous out in the wild to travel alone.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_060
Text=You must visit Patty's Party Planning Place in the west of town and recruit some companions.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_070
Text=Of course, even if you do find the thief's key, you must resist the urge to use it to poke your nose where it is not wanted<--->in people's houses, for example.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_070
Text=I say this as it was once in the possession of a reprobate by the name of Kirk Buzzer. He used it to get up to all manner of mischief.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_070
Text=Thankfully, he now resides in the castle jail, atoning for his transgressions. Naturally, I do not expect an upstanding youth such as yourself to follow in his foolish footsteps.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_080
Text=Now, should you ever find yourself unsure where to go next on your journey, call in at the nearest town. The locals might know something of use to you.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_080
Text=Even the most frivolous rumour could contain a vital clue, leading you one step closer to vanquishing the Archfiend.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0210_080
Text=And where better to hear such talk than the local watering hole or inn! Frankly, anywhere people gather is well worth a visit.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: This should go without saying, but weapons and armour are no good to you if you forget to equip them.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: But of course, you're the archetypal {WORD}, aren't you, {HERO}? You'd never make a schoolboy error like that.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: I've heard you're quite the {WORD}, {HERO}, but you still need to be careful not to make silly mistakes.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: Sorry. I don't mean to get all preachy.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0310_010
Text=*: I just worry about the biggest {WORD} I ever met setting off into the world alone, you know?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: The further forward a person is in battle, the more likely they are to get hit by attacks.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: That's why you always need to think very carefully about your party's line-up.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: You may be the biggest {WORD} in town, but not even you can survive on your own, {HERO}.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: You {WORD} types are likeable sorts, so I'm sure your companions will be happy to stand where you tell them to.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: You'll just have to suppress the {WORD} within you and learn to get on with people. No fighting with your friends, alright?
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: But I hardly need to tell you that. Like every other {WORD}, you're nothing if not a people person!
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0410_010
Text=*: You're carrying everyone's hopes on your shoulders. We're all counting on you to be a hero, {HERO}, so don't let us down.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_010
Text=*: If you're here to see the king, just carry on straight down this way.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_020
Text=*: Well, if it isn't the mighty {LEADER}! Welcome! It's an honour.
SelfId=TXT_Talk_Aliahan_Castle_2F_SUB_0_ACTOR_0510_030
